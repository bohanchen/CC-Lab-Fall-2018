# JQuery + P5.js

In this assignment, I used JQuery and P5.js to create a Fractal Tree using recursion. 
I used JQuery to make the toggle button and used P5 to draw the two sketches
The first sketch a stem keep braching out to two nodes until the length of the branches reached the limit. 
The second sketch is the thickness of the branch keep getting thinner at each node until it reachs to zero.
