            "A fractal tree index is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches and sequential access in the same time as a B-tree but with insertions and deletions that are asymptotically faster than a B-tree. Like a B-tree, a fractal tree index is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children".<br>
            In these two sketch, I used recursion to draw the fractal tree, which meants a function is defined by it self. Thus, the stem will branch out more brunches until it reach the end of the limit of length. <br>
