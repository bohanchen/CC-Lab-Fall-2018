# More inputs!
In this project, I used one digital sensor and one analog sensor to control different LEDs and a buzzer. 

I used the ultrasonic sensor (digital sensor) to control the red LED and the buzzer. If people get too closer to the sensor, the red LED will turn on as well as the buzzer. 

I also used the joystick (analog sensor) to control the RGB LED. I only connect to the Green and Blue pin, so the color of LED can only be blue and green. 

## Challenge:
I don't have challenge when I am connecting the ultrasonic sensor to the buzzer and red LED. 
However, it is quiet diffcult to get the RGB LED to work correctly. It takes me while to get the LED to turn on. I first check my code and then I check the circuit. In the end, my problem is I connect the positive and negative in the wrong way. Then it is working. Although it is not perfect, it response to the joystick.
