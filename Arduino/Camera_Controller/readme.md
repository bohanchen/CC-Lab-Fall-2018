# Camera Controller
In this project, I am going to create a remote camera controller with arduino and processing/web & node.js. I am still testing which plat form is better to deliever this project. 

My topic is going to be on censorship and online privacy. I choose this topic because I am inspired by the movie Citizen Four, which told me that our data are not safe. In this information overloaded age, we are exposed in the internet. Thus, I want to make a project that reflect this issue. 

I want the camera to be interacting with what people are typing and saying online. I want to bring not only public awarness, but also allow people to understand the consequence if they don't protect their privacy online. 

## Protytpe
I created a working prototype with processing and svero motor. Basically, the camera rotate to different angles based on users' mouse input. In the next step, I want to control the camera based on users' input or even voice command, if there is avaiable API I can use. 

## Feedback
Based on the feedback and user-testing, people want this project to be more interesting and fun. For instnace, they really want to know what the consequnece of the internet survelliance. What would happened if they post anything inappropriate oinline. Addtionally, what would happen these conseuqnece happened anonymously, which people are not aware there will a consequence.
